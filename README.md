# SingleCueSplitter
A multi-folders cue splitter.
### Why I created this project ?
Cause I was frustated with CueSplitter from Medieval! Their tool is so complicated.
### How works mine ?
It works simply by choosing :
- an output format (only tested with mp3 or aac/m4a)
- an input folder (which may contains others folders) that contains at least one cue file
- an output folder, in which put the result folders and converted files
### Cause I love it...
The output files are auto-tagged with infos.
